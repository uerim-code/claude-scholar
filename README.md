## Core Workflows

### Primary Workflows

Complete academic research lifecycle - 7 stages from idea to publication.

#### 1. Research Ideation (Zotero-Integrated)

End-to-end research startup from idea generation to literature management:

**Tools**: `research-ideation` skill + `literature-reviewer` agent + Zotero MCP

**Process**:
- **5W1H Brainstorming**: What, Why, Who, When, Where, How → structured thinking framework
- **Literature Search & Import**: WebSearch finds papers → extract DOIs → auto-import to Zotero via `add_items_by_doi` → classify into themed sub-collections (Core Papers, Methods, Applications, Baselines, To-Read)
- **PDF & Full-Text**: `find_and_attach_pdfs` batch-attaches open-access PDFs → `get_item_fulltext` reads full paper content for deep analysis (fallback: abstract + domain knowledge)
- **Gap Analysis**: 5 types (Literature, Methodological, Application, Interdisciplinary, Temporal) → identify 2-3 concrete research opportunities
- **Research Question**: SMART principles → formulate specific, measurable questions
- **Method Selection & Planning**: Evaluate method applicability → timeline, milestones, risk assessment

**Zotero Collection Structure**:
```
📁 Research-{Topic}-{YYYY-MM}
  ├── 📁 Core Papers
  ├── 📁 Methods
  ├── 📁 Applications
  ├── 📁 Baselines
  └── 📁 To-Read
```

**Output**: `literature-review.md` + `research-proposal.md` + `references.bib` (exported from Zotero) + organized Zotero collection with PDFs

**Commands**:
- `/research-init "topic"` → full workflow: create Zotero collection → search & import papers → full-text analysis → gap analysis → generate review & proposal
- `/zotero-review "collection"` → analyze an existing Zotero collection → generate literature review with comparison matrix
- `/zotero-notes "collection"` → batch read papers → generate structured reading notes (summary/detailed/comparison formats)

#### 2. ML Project Development

Maintainable ML project structure for experiment code:

**Tools**: `architecture-design` skill + `code-reviewer` agent + `git-workflow` skill

**Process**:
- **Structure**: Factory & Registry patterns → config-driven models (only `cfg` parameter) → enforced by `rules/coding-style.md`
- **Code Style**: 200-400 line files → type hints required → `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for configs → max 3-level nesting
- **Debug** (`bug-detective`): Error pattern matching for Python/Bash/JS → stack trace analysis → anti-pattern identification
- **Git**: Conventional Commits (`feat/scope: message`) → branch strategy (master/develop/feature) → merge with `--no-ff`

**Commands**: `/plan`, `/commit`, `/code-review`, `/tdd`

#### 3. Experiment Analysis

Statistical analysis and visualization of experimental results:

**Tools**: `results-analysis` skill + `results-report` skill + `data-analyst` agent

**Process**:
- **Data Processing**: Automated cleaning and preprocessing of experiment logs
- **Statistical Testing**: t-test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon signed-rank → validate significance
- **Visualization**: strict scientific figure generation → publication-ready figures with interpretation guidance
- **Ablation Studies**: Systematic component analysis → understand contribution of each part

**Command**: `/analyze-results <experiment_dir>` → generates a strict analysis bundle (analysis report, stats appendix, figure catalog, figures)

#### 4. Paper Writing

Systematic paper writing from template to final draft:

**Tools**: `ml-paper-writing` skill + `paper-miner` agent + `latex-conference-template-organizer` skill

**Process**:
- **Template Preparation**: Download conference .zip → extract main files → remove sample content → clean Overleaf-ready structure
- **Citation Verification** (`citation-verification`): Multi-layer validation (Format → API → Information → Content) → prevents hallucinations
- **Systematic Writing**: Narrative framing → 5-sentence abstract formula → section-by-section drafting with feedback cycles
- **Anti-AI Processing** (`writing-anti-ai`): Remove inflated symbolism, promotional language, vague attributions → add human voice and rhythm → bilingual support (EN/CN)

**Venues**: NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, COLM, Nature, Science, Cell, PNAS

#### 5. Paper Self-Review

Quality assurance before submission:

**Tools**: `paper-self-review` skill

**Process**:
- **Structure Check**: Logical flow, section balance, narrative coherence
- **Logic Validation**: Argument soundness, claim-evidence alignment, assumption clarity
- **Citation Audit**: Reference accuracy, proper attribution, citation completeness
- **Figure Quality**: Visual clarity, caption completeness, color accessibility
- **Writing Polish**: Grammar, clarity, conciseness, academic tone
- **Compliance**: Page limits, formatting requirements, ethical disclosures

**6-item checklist** → systematic quality assessment

#### 6. Submission & Rebuttal

Paper submission and review response:

**Tools**: `review-response` skill + `rebuttal-writer` agent

**Submission Process**:
- **Pre-submission**: Conference-specific checklists (NeurIPS 16-item, ICML Broader Impact, ICLR LLM disclosure)
- **Format Check**: Page limits, anonymization, supplementary materials
- **Final Review**: Proofread, check references, verify figures

**Rebuttal Process**:
- **Review Analysis**: Parse and classify comments (Major/Minor/Typo/Misunderstanding)
- **Response Strategy**: Accept/Defend/Clarify/Experiment → tailored approach per comment type
- **Rebuttal Writing**: Structured response with evidence and reasoning
- **Tone Management**: Professional, respectful, evidence-based language

**Command**: `/rebuttal <review_file>` → generates complete rebuttal document with experiment plan

#### 7. Post-Acceptance Processing

Conference preparation and research promotion:

**Tools**: `post-acceptance` skill

**Process**:
- **Presentation**: Slide creation guidance (15/20/30 min formats) → visual design principles → storytelling structure
- **Poster**: Academic poster templates (A0/A1 sizes) → layout optimization → visual hierarchy
- **Promotion**: Social media content (Twitter/X, LinkedIn) → blog posts → press releases → research summaries

**Commands**: `/presentation`, `/poster`, `/promote` → automated content generation

**Coverage**: 90% of academic research lifecycle (from idea to publication)

### Supporting Workflows

These workflows run in the background to enhance the primary workflows.

#### Automated Enforcement Workflow

Cross-platform hooks (Node.js) automate workflow enforcement:

```
Session Start → Skill Evaluation → Session End → Session Stop
```

- **skill-forced-eval** (`skill-forced-eval.js`): Before EVERY user prompt → groups all available skills (local + plugins) into 6 categories → silent scan mode, only outputs matched skills → additionally hints `obsidian-project-memory` / literature bridge flow inside bound research repos → requires activation before implementation
- **session-start** (`session-start.js`): Session begins → displays Git status, pending todos, available commands (top 5 with fold count), package manager, and bound Obsidian project-memory status → shows project context at a glance
- **session-summary** (`session-summary.js`): Session ends → generates comprehensive work log → summarizes all changes made → provides smart recommendations for next steps → reminds minimum Obsidian write-back for bound repos → auto-cleans logs older than 30 days
- **stop-summary** (`stop-summary.js`): Session stops → quick status check with separate added/modified/deleted counts → groups temp files by folder (top 3 per folder) → reminds minimum Obsidian maintenance for bound repos
- **security-guard** (`security-guard.js`): Two-tier security system — **Block tier**: immediately rejects catastrophic commands (rm -rf /, dd, mkfs, system dirs); **Confirm tier**: injects systemMessage forcing model to ask user before executing dangerous-but-legitimate operations (git push --force, git reset --hard, chmod 777, SQL DROP/DELETE/TRUNCATE, sensitive file writes)

**Cross-platform**: All hooks use Node.js (not shell scripts) ensuring Windows/macOS/Linux compatibility.

#### Knowledge Extraction Workflow

Two specialized mining agents continuously extract knowledge to improve skills:

- **paper-miner** (agent): Analyze research papers (PDF/DOCX/arXiv links) → extracts writing patterns, structure insights, venue requirements, rebuttal strategies → updates `ml-paper-writing/references/knowledge/` with categorized entries (structure.md, writing-techniques.md, submission-guides.md, review-response.md)
- **kaggle-miner** (agent): Study winning Kaggle competition solutions → extract competition briefs, front-runner detailed technical analysis, code templates, best practices → update the `kaggle-learner` skill's knowledge base (`references/knowledge/[domain]/` directories, categorized by NLP/CV/Time Series/Tabular/Multimodal)

**Knowledge feedback loop**: Each paper or solution analyzed enriches the knowledge base, creating a self-improving system that evolves with your research.

#### Skill Evolution System

3-step continuous improvement cycle for maintaining and improving skills:

```
skill-development → skill-quality-reviewer → skill-improver
```

1. **Develop** (`skill-development`): Create skills with proper YAML frontmatter → clear descriptions with trigger phrases → progressive disclosure (lean SKILL.md, details in `references/`)
2. **Review** (`skill-quality-reviewer`): 4-dimension quality assessment → Description Quality (25%), Content Organization (30%), Writing Style (20%), Structural Integrity (25%) → generates improvement plan with prioritized fixes
3. **Improve** (`skill-improver`): Merges suggested changes → updates documentation → iterates on feedback → reads improvement plans and applies changes automatically

## Quick Start

### Installation Options

Choose the installation method that fits your needs:

#### Option 1: Full Installation (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
bash /tmp/claude-scholar/scripts/setup.sh
```

The script merges skills/commands/agents/rules/hooks into your existing `~/.claude`, and adds hooks/mcpServers/enabledPlugins to your `settings.json` (auto-backup to `settings.json.bak`). Your env and permissions are untouched.

**Includes**: 47 skills, 32 top-level commands, 16 agents, 5 hooks, and project rules.

#### Option 2: Minimal Installation

Core hooks and essential skills only (faster load, less complexity):

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar

# Copy only hooks and core skills
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks ~/.claude/skills
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/hooks/*.js ~/.claude/hooks/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/ml-paper-writing ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/research-ideation ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/results-analysis ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/results-report ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/review-response ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/writing-anti-ai ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/git-workflow ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/bug-detective ~/.claude/skills/

# Cleanup
rm -rf /tmp/claude-scholar
```

**Post-install**: Merge hooks config into your `settings.json` — see `settings.json.template` for the required hooks entries.

**Includes**: 5 hooks, 8 core skills (complete research workflow + essential development).

#### Option 3: Selective Installation

Pick and choose specific components:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
cd /tmp/claude-scholar

# Copy what you need, for example:
# - Hooks only
cp hooks/*.js ~/.claude/hooks/

# - Specific skills
cp -r skills/latex-conference-template-organizer ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/architecture-design ~/.claude/skills/

# - Specific agents
cp agents/paper-miner.md ~/.claude/agents/

# - Project rules
cp rules/coding-style.md ~/.claude/rules/
cp rules/agents.md ~/.claude/rules/
```

**Post-install**: Merge hooks config into your `settings.json` — see `settings.json.template`.

**Recommended for**: Advanced users who want custom configurations.

### Requirements

- Claude Code CLI
- Git
- Node.js (required for hooks)
- uv, Python (for Python development)
- **Zotero** (for Zotero MCP features)
- **Obsidian** (optional UI/CLI layer for the built-in project knowledge base)

### MCP Setup

See [MCP_SETUP.md](./MCP_SETUP.md) for Zotero/browser MCP setup and [OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md](./OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md) for the built-in Obsidian knowledge base workflow.

#### Zotero MCP (Zotero-integrated workflows)

Install the MCP server:

```bash
# Install from Galaxy-Dawn fork (Web API mode)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/zotero-mcp.git
```

Then add to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zotero": {
      "command": "zotero-mcp",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "env": {
        "ZOTERO_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID": "your-library-id",
        "ZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE": "user",
        "UNPAYWALL_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
        "UNSAFE_OPERATIONS": "all"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Obsidian Project Knowledge Base

Claude Scholar now includes a built-in Obsidian project knowledge base with no MCP requirement. See [OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md](./OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md).

Default literature graph artifact: `Maps/literature.canvas`  
Optional views: explicit-only via `/obsidian-views`

Main commands:

- `/obsidian-init`
- `/obsidian-ingest`
- `/obsidian-sync`
- `/obsidian-link`
- `/obsidian-review`
- `/obsidian-notes`
- `/obsidian-note`
- `/obsidian-project`
- `/obsidian-views`

### First Run

After installation, the hooks provide automated workflow assistance:

1. **Every prompt** triggers `skill-forced-eval` → ensures applicable skills are considered and bound research repos get the right Obsidian skill hints
2. **Session starts** with `session-start` → displays project context and bound project-memory status
3. **Sessions end** with `session-summary` → generates work log with recommendations and minimum Obsidian write-back reminders
4. **Session stops** with `stop-summary` → provides status check and lightweight bound-repo maintenance reminders

## Project Rules

### Coding Style

Enforced by `rules/coding-style.md`:
- **File Size**: 200-400 lines maximum
- **Immutability**: Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for configs
- **Type Hints**: Required for all functions
- **Patterns**: Factory & Registry for all modules
- **Config-Driven**: Models accept only `cfg` parameter

### Agent Orchestration

Defined in `rules/agents.md`:
- Available agent types and purposes
- Parallel task execution
- Multi-perspective analysis

### Security

Defined in `rules/security.md`:
- Secrets management (environment variables, `.env` files)
- Sensitive file protection (never commit tokens, keys, credentials)
- Pre-commit security checks via hooks

### Experiment Reproducibility

Defined in `rules/experiment-reproducibility.md`:
- Random seed management for reproducibility
- Configuration recording (Hydra auto-save)
- Environment recording and checkpoint management
