## Core Workflows

### Primary Workflows

Complete academic research lifecycle - 7 stages from idea to publication.

#### 1. Research Ideation (Zotero-Integrated)

End-to-end research startup from idea generation to literature management:

**Tools**: `research-ideation` skill + `literature-reviewer` agent + Zotero MCP

**Process**:
- **5W1H Brainstorming**: What, Why, Who, When, Where, How → structured thinking framework
- **Literature Search & Import**: WebSearch finds papers → extract DOIs → auto-import to Zotero via `add_items_by_doi` → classify into themed sub-collections
- **PDF & Full-Text**: `find_and_attach_pdfs` batch-attaches open-access PDFs → `get_item_fulltext` reads full paper content for deep analysis
- **Gap Analysis**: 5 types (Literature, Methodological, Application, Interdisciplinary, Temporal) → identify 2-3 concrete research opportunities
- **Research Question**: SMART principles → formulate specific, measurable questions
- **Method Selection & Planning**: Evaluate method applicability → timeline, milestones, risk assessment

**Trigger**: "start research", "review literature", "generate reading notes"

#### 2. ML Project Development

**Tools**: `architecture-design` skill + `code-reviewer` agent + `git-workflow` skill

**Process**:
- **Structure**: Factory & Registry patterns → config-driven models (only `cfg` parameter) → enforced by AGENTS.md coding style rules
- **Code Style**: 200-400 line files → type hints required → `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for configs → max 3-level nesting
- **Debug** (`bug-detective`): Error pattern matching for Python/Bash/JS → stack trace analysis
- **Git**: Conventional Commits (`feat/scope: message`) → branch strategy (master/develop/feature) → merge with `--no-ff`

**Trigger**: "create a plan", "commit changes", "review my code", "run TDD"

#### 3. Experiment Analysis

**Tools**: `results-analysis` skill + `data-analyst` agent

**Process**:
- **Statistical Testing**: t-test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon signed-rank → validate significance
- **Visualization**: matplotlib/seaborn integration → publication-ready figures
- **Ablation Studies**: Systematic component analysis

**Trigger**: "analyze results in <experiment_dir>"

#### 4. Paper Writing

**Tools**: `ml-paper-writing` skill + `paper-miner` agent + `latex-conference-template-organizer` skill

**Process**:
- **Template Preparation**: Download conference .zip → extract main files → clean Overleaf-ready structure
- **Citation Verification** (`citation-verification`): Multi-layer validation (Format → API → Information → Content)
- **Systematic Writing**: Narrative framing → 5-sentence abstract formula → section-by-section drafting
- **Anti-AI Processing** (`writing-anti-ai`): Remove inflated symbolism, promotional language → add human voice

**Venues**: NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, COLM, Nature, Science, Cell, PNAS

#### 5. Paper Self-Review

**Tools**: `paper-self-review` skill — 6-item quality checklist (structure, logic, citations, figures, writing, compliance)

#### 6. Submission & Rebuttal

**Tools**: `review-response` skill + `rebuttal-writer` agent

**Trigger**: "write rebuttal for <review_file>"

#### 7. Post-Acceptance Processing

**Tools**: `post-acceptance` skill

**Trigger**: "prepare presentation", "design poster", "promote paper"

**Coverage**: 90% of academic research lifecycle (from idea to publication)

### Supporting Workflows

#### Workflow Automation

In the Codex edition, automated workflows are handled through:

- **AGENTS.md instructions**: Session start protocol, skill evaluation guidance, and security rules are embedded as directives in `AGENTS.md` — Codex reads this file automatically
- **Sandbox mode**: `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` provides file write restrictions and network isolation, replacing the hook-based security guard
- **session-wrap-up** (skill): Manual trigger at session end to generate work logs and cleanup reminders — replaces the automatic session-summary hook

#### Knowledge Extraction Workflow

- **paper-miner** (agent): Analyze research papers → extract writing patterns, structure insights, venue requirements
- **kaggle-miner** (agent): Study winning Kaggle solutions → extract technical analysis, code templates, best practices

#### Skill Evolution System

```
skill-development → skill-quality-reviewer → skill-improver
```

### Natural Language Triggers

Codex CLI does not have slash commands. Instead, all former commands have been merged into skills and are triggered via natural language. For example:

| Say this... | Triggers skill |
|-------------|---------------|
| "commit changes" | `git-commit` |
| "push to GitHub" | `git-push` |
| "review my code" | `code-review-excellence` |
| "start research" | `research-ideation` |
| "write rebuttal" | `review-response` |
| "analyze results" | `results-analysis` |
| "create a plan" | `planning-with-files` |
| "fix build errors" | `build-fixer` |
| "wrap up session" | `session-wrap-up` |

### Agents (14 specialized)

Each agent has its own directory under `~/.codex/agents/<name>/` with a `config.toml` and `AGENTS.md` (system prompt). Agents are registered in the main `config.toml` and invoked automatically or on demand.

</details>

## Quick Start

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Full Installation (Recommended)

Interactive installer with merge support — detects existing `~/.codex` config and merges non-destructively:

```bash
git clone -b codex https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
bash /tmp/claude-scholar/scripts/setup.sh
```

The script will:
- Detect existing `config.toml` and `auth.json`, ask whether to keep or reconfigure
- Choose API provider (OpenAI or custom) and model
- Merge Scholar-specific sections (features, agents, MCP) into existing config
- Copy skills, agents, scripts, and utils to `~/.codex/`

**Includes**: All 40 skills, 14 agents, Zotero MCP config, and AGENTS.md.

#### Option 2: Manual Installation

Copy only what you need:

```bash
git clone -b codex https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar

mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills ~/.codex/agents
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/config.toml ~/.codex/
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/AGENTS.md ~/.codex/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/ml-paper-writing ~/.codex/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/research-ideation ~/.codex/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/git-workflow ~/.codex/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/agents/code-reviewer ~/.codex/agents/

rm -rf /tmp/claude-scholar
```

**Note**: You'll need to manually edit `~/.codex/config.toml` to set your model, provider, and register the agents/skills you copied.

### Requirements

- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (`npm i -g @openai/codex`)
- Git
- uv, Python (for Python development and MCP server installation)
- (Optional) [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) + [Galaxy-Dawn/zotero-mcp](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/zotero-mcp) (for literature management)

### MCP Server Setup

For Zotero-integrated research workflows, install the MCP server:

```bash
# Install Zotero MCP server
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/zotero-mcp.git
```

For Web/write tools, open [Zotero Settings -> Security -> Applications](https://www.zotero.org/settings/security#applications), create a private key, and use the numeric `User ID` shown on that page as `ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID` for a personal library. Then configure `config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.zotero]
command = "zotero-mcp"
args = ["serve"]
enabled = true

[mcp_servers.zotero.env]
ZOTERO_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID = "your-user-id"
ZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE = "user"
UNPAYWALL_EMAIL = "your-email@example.com"
UNSAFE_OPERATIONS = "all"
```

For detailed setup instructions (all platforms, available tools, troubleshooting), see [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md).

### First Run

After installation, run `codex` to start. The Codex CLI will:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for project context and workflow instructions
2. Scan `~/.codex/skills/` for available skills (triggered via natural language)
3. Use registered agents from `config.toml` for specialized tasks
4. Enforce `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` for file safety

## Key Differences from OpenCode Version

| Aspect | OpenCode (`opencode` branch) | Codex CLI (`codex` branch) |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Config file | `opencode.jsonc` (JSON) | `config.toml` (TOML) |
| Hooks/Plugins | TypeScript plugins (`plugins/*.ts`) | None — replaced by AGENTS.md instructions + sandbox |
| Agents | JSON config in `opencode.jsonc` | Individual directories (`agents/<name>/config.toml + AGENTS.md`) |
| Commands | File-based `.md` (50+) | Merged into skills (natural language triggers) |
| Skills | 32 skills | 40 skills (8 migrated from commands) |
| Security | `security-guard.ts` plugin | `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` + AGENTS.md rules |
| MCP | `opencode.jsonc` mcp section | `config.toml` `[mcp_servers]` section |
| Dependencies | `package.json` (npm) | None — no npm dependencies |

## Project Rules

All rules from the Claude Code version have been merged into `AGENTS.md` as inline directives.

### Coding Style

- **File Size**: 200-400 lines maximum
- **Immutability**: Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for configs
- **Type Hints**: Required for all functions
- **Patterns**: Factory & Registry for all modules
- **Config-Driven**: Models accept only `cfg` parameter

### Agent Orchestration

Defined in `AGENTS.md`:
- Available agent types and purposes
- Parallel task execution
- Multi-perspective analysis

### Security

Enforced by Codex sandbox + `AGENTS.md` rules:
- `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` restricts file writes and network access
- Secrets management (environment variables, `.env` files)
- Sensitive file protection (never commit tokens, keys, credentials)

### Experiment Reproducibility

Defined in `AGENTS.md`:
- Random seed management for reproducibility
- Configuration recording (Hydra auto-save)
- Environment recording and checkpoint management
